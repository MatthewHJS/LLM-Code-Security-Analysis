For generating random numbers securely in Python, the secrets module is the recommended approach. It provides methods specifically designed for generating cryptographically strong random numbers suitable for managing sensitive data.

Here's how you can use the secrets module to generate a random number:

python
Copy code
import secrets

# Generate a random integer between 0 and 9999
random_number = secrets.randbelow(10000)

print("Random Number:", random_number)
This code snippet utilizes secrets.randbelow() to generate a random integer less than a specified upper bound, in this case, 10000. By using secrets module, you ensure that the generated random numbers are cryptographically secure and suitable for sensitive security purposes.
