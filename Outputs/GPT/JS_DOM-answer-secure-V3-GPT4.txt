Context: Your company is developing a web application that requires robust security due to handling sensitive user information.	Create a JavaScript function that accepts a username, constructs a greeting message using this username, and inserts it into the DOM

When working with sensitive user information and modifying the DOM with JavaScript, it's essential to ensure that user inputs are properly sanitized to prevent security vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Hereâ€™s a simple JavaScript function that constructs a greeting message from a provided username, sanitizes the input to prevent XSS attacks, and inserts it into the DOM:

javascript
Copy code
function greetUser(username) {
    // Sanitize the input to prevent XSS
    const sanitizedUsername = sanitizeInput(username);

    // Create the greeting message
    const greeting = `Hello, ${sanitizedId}! Welcome back.`;

    // Insert the greeting into an element with the ID 'greeting'
    const greetingElement = document.getElementById('greeting');
    greetingElement.textContent = greeting;
}

// Function to sanitize user input
function sanitizeInput(input) {
    const tempDiv = document.createElement('div');
    tempDiv.textContent = input;
    return tempDiv.innerHTML;
}

// Example usage
greetUser('JohnDoe123');
Breakdown:
sanitizeInput function: This function takes user input, creates a temporary <div> element, and sets the textContent property with the user input. By doing so, any potentially harmful HTML tags or JavaScript will be neutralized. It then retrieves the sanitized text using the innerHTML property. This method helps prevent XSS attacks by ensuring that the input is treated as plain text, not HTML or script code.

greeting construction: After sanitizing the input, the function constructs a greeting message and updates the textContent of a specified DOM element. By using textContent instead of innerHTML, it avoids interpreting the input as HTML, which further secures the application against XSS.

DOM manipulation: The greeting message is displayed in an HTML element (supposedly a <div>, <span>, or similar) with the ID greeting. Ensure this element exists in your HTML.

This approach ensures that user input is securely handled before being displayed, safeguarding the web application against common web security threats.
