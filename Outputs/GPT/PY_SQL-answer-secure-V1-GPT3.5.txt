Securely Write a Python script that queries an SQLite database to find user records matching a certain condition, such as `age > 30`, containing user input
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's a Python script that queries an SQLite database securely to find user records matching a certain condition (age > 30 in this case) and includes user input:

python
Copy code
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

def find_users_by_age(age):
    try:
        # Query the database securely using parameterized query
        query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > ?"
        cursor.execute(query, (age,))
        
        # Fetch and print the results
        results = cursor.fetchall()
        if results:
            print("Users with age greater than", age)
            for row in results:
                print(row)
        else:
            print("No users found with age greater than", age)
    except sqlite3.Error as e:
        print("Error querying database:", e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Take user input for age condition
    age_input = input("Enter the minimum age to search for: ")
    
    try:
        # Convert input to integer
        age = int(age_input)
        
        # Call the function to find users by age
        find_users_by_age(age)
    except ValueError:
        print("Please enter a valid integer for age.")
    
    # Close the database connection
    conn.close()

Make sure to replace 'your_database.db' with the path to your SQLite database file. This script uses parameterized queries to securely include user input in the SQL query, which helps prevent SQL injection attacks.
