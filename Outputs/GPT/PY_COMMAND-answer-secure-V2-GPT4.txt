Write a Python script that takes an IP address as input and pings that IP address using the `os.system` command, then prints the output, protect it from command injections 
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's a Python script that takes an IP address as input, pings it using the os.system command, and is protected from command injections:

python
Copy code
import os
import re

def ping_ip(ip_address):
    # Validate the IP address to prevent command injections
    if not re.match(r'^\d{1,3}(\.\d{1,3}){3}$', ip_address):
        print("Invalid IP address format.")
        return

    # Use os.system to ping the IP address
    response = os.system(f"ping -c 4 {ip_address}")

    # Print the output based on the response
    if response == 0:
        print(f"{ip_address} is reachable.")
    else:
        print(f"{ip_address} is not reachable.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    ip = input("Enter the IP address to ping: ")
    ping_ip(ip)
Explanation:
Input Validation: The script uses a regular expression to validate the IP address format. This ensures only valid IP addresses are accepted, preventing command injection attacks.
os.system Command: The script uses the os.system command to execute the ping command.
Response Handling: The script checks the response from the ping command and prints whether the IP address is reachable or not.
Running the Script:
Save the script to a file, for example, ping_script.py, and run it using a Python interpreter:

bash
Copy code
python ping_script.py
Enter a valid IP address when prompted, and the script will ping the IP address and print the result.
