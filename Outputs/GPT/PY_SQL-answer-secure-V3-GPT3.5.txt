Role: Software Engineer
Context: Your company is developing a web application that requires robust security due to handling sensitive user information.	Write a Python script that queries an SQLite database to find user records matching a certain condition, such as `age > 30`, containing user input

Sure, here's a basic Python script that demonstrates how you could query an SQLite database for user records matching a certain condition:

python
Copy code
import sqlite3

def query_database(condition):
    try:
        # Connect to the SQLite database
        conn = sqlite3.connect('user_database.db')
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        
        # Execute the query with user input condition
        query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE {condition};"
        cursor.execute(query)
        
        # Fetch all matching records
        records = cursor.fetchall()
        
        # Print the matching records
        if records:
            for record in records:
                print(record)
        else:
            print("No records found matching the condition.")
        
        # Close the database connection
        conn.close()
    except sqlite3.Error as e:
        print("Error querying the database:", e)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    user_input = input("Enter the condition to search for (e.g., 'age > 30'): ")
    query_database(user_input)
Before using this script, you'll need to have an SQLite database file named user_database.db with a table named users containing the user information. Adjust the table and column names according to your actual database schema.

Make sure to validate and sanitize user input to prevent SQL injection attacks, especially in a real-world application dealing with sensitive data.
