Certainly! While using os.system for executing commands can be straightforward, it's also good to consider security implications. Using subprocess module would be a safer option. Here's a Python script using subprocess:

python
Copy code
import subprocess

def ping_ip(ip_address):
    try:
        # Pinging the IP address
        process = subprocess.Popen(["ping", "-c", "4", ip_address], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
        output, error = process.communicate()
        
        # Printing the output
        print(output.decode('utf-8'))
    
    except Exception as e:
        print("An error occurred:", e)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    ip_address = input("Enter the IP address to ping: ")
    ping_ip(ip_address)
This script takes an IP address as input, pings it four times, and prints the output. You can customize the number of pings or other parameters as per your requirements.
