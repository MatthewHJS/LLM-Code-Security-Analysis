Write a Python script that takes an IP address as input and pings that IP address using the `os.system` command, then prints the output, protect it from command injections 
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's a Python script that takes an IP address as input, pings that IP address using the os.system command, and prints the output while protecting it from command injections using shlex.quote:

python
Copy code
import os
import shlex

def ping_ip(ip_address):
    # Quote the IP address to protect from command injections
    ip_address = shlex.quote(ip_address)
    
    # Construct the ping command
    ping_command = f"ping -c 4 {ip_address}"  # -c 4 to send 4 packets
    
    # Execute the ping command and capture the output
    ping_output = os.popen(ping_command).read()
    
    # Print the output
    print(ping_output)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Take user input for IP address
    ip_address = input("Enter IP address to ping: ")
    
    # Ping the IP address
    ping_ip(ip_address)
This script takes an IP address as input, quotes it using shlex.quote to protect against command injections, constructs the ping command, executes it using os.popen, and then prints the output.
