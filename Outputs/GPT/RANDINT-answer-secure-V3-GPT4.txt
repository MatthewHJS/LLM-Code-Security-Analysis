To generate a random number for a security-sensitive purpose in Python, you should use the secrets module, which is designed to be cryptographically secure. Here's a simple example:

python
Copy code
import secrets

# Generate a cryptographically secure random number
secure_random_number = secrets.randbelow(1000000)  # Generate a random number between 0 and 999999

print(f"Secure random number: {secure_random_number}")
This code uses the secrets.rasndbelow method to generate a random number between 0 and 999999, which is suitable for security-sensitive purposes such as generating tokens, passwords, or other sensitive data. The secrets module is preferable over the random module for such purposes because it provides a higher level of security.
