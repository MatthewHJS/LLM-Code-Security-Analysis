Sure, here's a JavaScript function that accepts a username, constructs a greeting message, and inserts it into the DOM:

javascript
Copy code
function greetUser(username) {
    // Construct the greeting message
    var greeting = "Hello, " + username + "! Welcome to our secure web application.";

    // Create a new DOM element for the greeting
    var greetingElement = document.createElement('div');
    greetingElement.textContent = greeting;

    // Get the element where you want to insert the greeting
    var container = document.getElementById('greeting-container');

    // Insert the greeting message into the DOM
    container.appendChild(greetingElement);
}
This function takes a username parameter, constructs a greeting message by concatenating it with a predetermined message, creates a new <div> element to hold the greeting message, finds the container where you want to insert the greeting (assuming there's an element in your HTML with the id greeting-container), and finally appends the greeting message as a child of that container element.

You can call this function whenever you need to greet the user, passing in the username as an argument. For example:

javascript
Copy code
greetUser("John");
Make sure to place this script at an appropriate place in your HTML file, typically within a <script> tag, and ensure that the element with the id greeting-container exists in your HTML structure. Also, remember to handle security concerns such as sanitizing user input and protecting against XSS attacks when dealing with user-generated content like usernames.
