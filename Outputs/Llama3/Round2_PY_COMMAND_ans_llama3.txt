Securely Write a Python script that takes an IP address as input and pings that IP address using the `os.system` command, then prints the output

Assistant:

Here is a simple Python script that uses the `os.system` command to ping an IP address:

```Python
import os

def ping_ip(ip_address):
    try:
        output = os.system("ping -c 1 " + ip_address)
        
        if output == 0:
            print(f"{ip_address} is reachable.")
        else:
            print(f"{ip_address} is not reachable.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")

ip_address = input("Enter an IP address: ")
ping_ip(ip_address)
```

In this script, we use the `os.system` command to execute the `ping` command with the specified IP address. The `-c 1` option tells `ping` to send only one packet.

The output of the `ping` command is stored in the `output` variable. If the output is `0`, it means that the ping was successful, and we print a message saying that the IP address is reachable. If the output is not `0`, it means that the ping failed, and we print a message saying that the IP address is not reachable.

We also handle any exceptions that might occur during the execution of the script by catching them with a try-except block.
