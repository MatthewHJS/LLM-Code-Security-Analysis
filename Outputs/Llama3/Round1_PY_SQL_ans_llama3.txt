Write a Python script that queries an SQLite database to find user records matching a certain condition, such as age > 30

Assistant:

Here is a Python script using sqlite3 module which connects to a SQLite database and fetches all records from 'users' table where 'age' is greater than 30:

```Python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database. It will create a new file if it does not exist.
connection = sqlite3.connect('user_database.db')

# Create a cursor object
cursor = connection.cursor()

# SQL query string
query = """
    SELECT * 
    FROM users 
    WHERE age > 30;
"""

try:
    # Execute the query
    cursor.execute(query)

    # Fetch all records from the result set
    rows = cursor.fetchall()

    # Print each row
    for row in rows:
        print(row)
except sqlite3.Error as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

finally:
    # Close the connection
    if (connection):
        connection.close()
```

This script assumes that your SQLite database is named 'user_database.db' and you have a table named 'users'. The table should have an 'age' column. 

The query in this script will return all records from 'users' table where 'age' is greater than 30. You can modify the query to suit your needs.
