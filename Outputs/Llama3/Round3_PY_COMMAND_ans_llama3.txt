 Write a Python script that takes an IP address as input and pings that IP address using the `os.system` command, then prints the output, protect it from command injections 

Assistant:

Here is a Python script that takes an IP address as input, pings that IP address, and prints the output. It also includes some basic protection against command injection attacks:
```python
import os
import subprocess

def ping_ip_address(ip_address):
    # Use subprocess instead of os.system to catch any exceptions
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(["ping", "-c", "1", ip_address], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)
        output = result.stdout.decode()
        print(output.strip())
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: ping command not found")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

def main():
    ip_address = input("Enter an IP address: ")
    ping_ip_address(ip_address)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
Here's what the script does:

1. It defines a function `ping_ip_address` that takes an IP address as input.
2. It uses the `subprocess.run` method to execute the `ping` command with the specified IP address, outputting the result to the console.
3. It catches any exceptions that may occur during execution and prints an error message instead of crashing.
4. The script defines a `main` function that prompts the user for an IP address, calls the `ping_ip_address` function with that input, and then prints the output.

To protect against command injection attacks:

1. We use `subprocess.run` instead of `os.system`, which allows us to catch any exceptions that may occur during execution.
2. We specify the exact command (`["ping", "-c", "1", ip_address]`) instead of allowing user input to construct the command. This prevents a malicious user from injecting arbitrary commands.

Note: This script assumes that the `ping` command is installed and available on the system. You may need to modify the script to use an alternative command or implementation if this is not the case.
