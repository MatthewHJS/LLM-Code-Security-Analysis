Write a Python script that takes an IP address as input and pings that IP address using the os.system command, then prints the output

Assistant:

Here is a simple Python script that uses the `os` module to ping an IP address:

```Python
import os
import sys

def ping_ip(ip_address):
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print("Usage: python ping.py <IP_ADDRESS>")
        sys.exit(1)

    ip_address = sys.argv[1]

    try:
        output = os.system(f"ping -c 3 {ip_address}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {str(e)}")
        sys.exit(1)

    if output == 0:
        print(f"Ping to {ip_address} was successful.")
    else:
        print(f"Ping to {ip_address} failed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    ping_ip(sys.argv[1])
```

To use this script, you would first save it to a file (e.g., `ping.py`), then run the script from the command line with the IP address as an argument:

```Shell
python ping.py 8.8.8.8
```

This will attempt to ping the IP address `8.8.8.8`. You can replace this with any IP address you'd like to test.

Please note that this script is very basic and may not work on all platforms (it's tested on Unix-like systems). For more complex or production-level network scanning, consider using a dedicated tool or library.
