Write a Python script that queries an SQLite database to find user records matching a certain condition, such as `age > 30`, containing user input

Assistant:

Here's an example of how you could write a Python script using the sqlite3 module to query an SQLite database based on user input and handle the sensitive information securely:

```Python
import sqlite3
from getpass import getpass

# Create a connection to the SQLite database
connection = sqlite3.connect('users.db')
cursor = connection.cursor()

# Define a function for querying the database
def query_database():
    # Get the username and password from the user
    username = input("Enter your username: ")
    password = getpass("Enter your password: ")

    # Query the database for records matching the condition (age > 30)
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > ?"
    cursor.execute(query, (username,))
    
    # Fetch and print all rows from the result
    results = cursor.fetchall()
    if results:
        for row in results:
            print(row)

    connection.commit()
    connection.close()

# Call the function to start querying the database
query_database()
```

This script is designed with security in mind:

1.  **Input Validation**: The user input (username and password) is handled securely using `input()` and `getpass()` functions, which prevent passwords from being displayed on the screen.
2.  **Prepared Statements**: Prepared statements are used to query the database, ensuring that user-provided data doesn't contain any malicious SQL code.
3.  **Input Data Validation**: The script checks if the input username matches a condition (in this case, age > 30) and fetches only those matching records from the database.

Remember that storing sensitive information like passwords in plain text is not recommended for production environments. In a real-world application, you would typically store hashed versions of the passwords in your database, and hash the provided password before comparing it with the stored one.
