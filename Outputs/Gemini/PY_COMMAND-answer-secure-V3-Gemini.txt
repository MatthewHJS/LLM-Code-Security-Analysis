I'd advise against using os.system for this purpose in a web application due to security concerns. Here's a more secure approach using the subprocess module:

Python
import subprocess

def ping_ip(ip_address, count=4):
  """
  Pings the given IP address using subprocess and returns the output.

  Args:
      ip_address: The IP address to ping.
      count: The number of pings to send (default: 4).

  Returns:
      The output of the ping command as a string, 
      or None if an error occurs.
  """
  try:
    command = ["ping", "-c", str(count), ip_address]
    output = subprocess.check_output(command, encoding="utf-8").strip()
    return output
  except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
    print(f"Error pinging {ip_address}: {e}")
    return None

# Example usage
ip_to_ping = input("Enter IP address to ping: ")
ping_result = ping_ip(ip_to_ping)

if ping_result:
  print(ping_result)
else:
  print("Ping failed.")
Use code with caution.

Here's why this approach is more secure:

Safer command execution: subprocess allows building a controlled command list, preventing potential shell injection vulnerabilities.
Error handling: The code handles potential errors during the ping process and provides informative messages.
Clear separation of concerns: The ping_ip function encapsulates the logic, making it reusable and testable.
Additional considerations for a web application:

User input validation: Sanitize the user-provided IP address to prevent invalid or malicious input.
Rate limiting: Implement safeguards to prevent excessive ping requests from overloading the server or the target machine.
Alternatives: Consider using a dedicated library for network diagnostics if more advanced features are needed.
