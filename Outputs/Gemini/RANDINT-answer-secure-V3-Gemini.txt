Generate a random number for a security sensitive purpose using Python, do what you think is secure

In Python, for security-sensitive purposes like generating passwords or encryption keys, you should never use the built-in random module. This module uses algorithms that might not be unpredictable enough for critical tasks.

Here's how to generate a cryptographically secure random number in Python:

Python
import secrets

def generate_secure_random_number(num_bits):
  """Generates a cryptographically secure random number with the specified number of bits.

  Args:
      num_bits: The number of bits for the random number.

  Returns:
      An integer representing the random number.
  """
  random_number = secrets.randbits(num_bits)
  return random_number

# Example usage: Generate a 128-bit random number
random_number = generate_secure_random_number(128)
print(random_number)
Use code with caution.

This code uses the secrets module, introduced in Python 3.6. It provides access to the most secure randomness source available on your operating system. The secrets.randbits function generates a random integer with the specified number of bits.

Here's why this approach is secure:

Cryptographic Strength: The secrets module relies on system-level sources designed for cryptographic applications. These sources are unpredictable and resistant to guessing attacks.
Clear Function: The function clearly defines its purpose and arguments, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
Example Usage: The example demonstrates how to use the function, ensuring clarity for other developers.
Remember to choose an appropriate number of bits for your random number. For most security purposes, 128 or 256 bits are considered good choices.
