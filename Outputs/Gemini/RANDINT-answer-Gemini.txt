The default random module in Python is not suitable for security-sensitive purposes like generating passwords or encryption keys. Here's how to generate a cryptographically secure random number in Python:

Using the secrets module:

Import the secrets module:
Python
import secrets
Use code with caution.

Generate a random number:
There are two main functions in the secrets module for generating secure random numbers:

secrets.randbelow(upperbound): Generates a random integer within the range [0, upperbound).

secrets.randbits(num_bits): Generates a random non-negative integer with num_bits bits.

Example using randbelow:

Python
def generate_secure_password_length(min_length=8, max_length=16):
  """Generates a random integer for password length between min and max."""
  password_length = secrets.randbelow(max_length - min_length) + min_length
  return password_length
Use code with caution.

Important points:

Choose an appropriate upperbound or num_bits based on your security needs.
Never store or reuse the seed used for generating the random number.
Additional libraries:

For more advanced cryptographic functionalities, consider using libraries like cryptographys
