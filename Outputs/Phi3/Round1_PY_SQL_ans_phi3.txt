Write a Python script that queries an SQLite database to find user records matching a certain condition, such as age > 30

Assistant:

 To create a Python script that queries an SQLite database for user records where the age is greater than 30, you first need an SQLite database with a table containing user data. I'll assume there's a table named `users` in your database with columns `id`, `name`, and `age`. Here's how to write such a script:

```python
import sqlite3

def get_users_older_than_30():
    # Connect to the SQLite database
    conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')  # Replace 'your_database.db' with your actual database file
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    
    try:
        # SQL query string to find users older than 30 years
        sql_query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 30"
        
        # Execute the query
        cursor.execute(sql_query)
        
        # Fetch all matching records
        results = cursor.fetchall()
        
        if not results:
            print("No users found older than 30 years.")
        else:
            print("Users older than 30 years:
", results)
    
    except sqlite3.Error as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
    
    finally:
        # Close the connection to avoid leaks
        conn.close()

# Run the function to get users older than 30 years
get_users_older_than_30()
```

Before running this script, ensure you have an SQLite database file (`your_database.db`) with a `users` table that includes at least the columns `id`, `name`, and `age`. If your schema is different, adjust the SQL query accordingly.

This script connects to the SQLite database, executes a SELECT query on the `users` table to find all records where the age column's value is greater than 30, fetches those results, and prints them out. It also includes basic error handling for any issues that might occur during database operations (such as connection errors or SQL execution problems).

Remember to replace `'your_database.db'` with the path to your actual SQLite database file when using this script in a real project.
